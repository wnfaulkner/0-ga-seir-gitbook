# Programming and Web Development Concepts Jeopardy
So far we've been learning web development with the JavaScript programming
language. We're going to begin learning Python, our second programming
language. We'll see what two programming languages share in common and see
how they're different.

Before we dive into our second language let's spend some time identifying
fundamental concepts we've encountered in our first programming language
and in the variety of web frameworks we've used. The more you're able to
identify these concepts apart from any individual programming language or
framework the easier understanding new programming languages and learning
new frameworks will be.

## Control Flow:

Q: "foo", "bar", and "baz" are common names for these types of variables.
A: What are metasyntactice variables? (variable names that show the name itself isn't special)

# Functions
Q: Functions are of this data type.
A: What is an object?

Q: They go in the parentheses of a function definition.
A: What are parameters?

Q: Functions that yield a value utilize this keyword in their definitions.
A: What is return?

Q: These functions can only ever be utilized as callbacks.
A: What are anonymous functions?

Q: 'world' in the function invokation `greeting('world')`
A: What is an argument?

Q: A function that takes another function as an argument.
A: What is a higher order function?


# Web Requests
Q: This HTTP verb is used to replace existing information with new information.
