# Don't Build a Skyscraper

You're a freshly-minted junior developer. Now you need to get a job. But you don't **know** anything.

Yes, you _understand_ that "you know more than you think you know," and that "all junior developers feel like this," and that "every developer is just making it up as they go along."

But understanding and _feeling_ are different things. Besides, someone else saying "been there, done that" won't put food on your table.

You've spent hours agonizing over your résumé and your LinkedIn profile, and still no fish are nibbling.

You gone through so many tutorials, but no-one knows you've done them, you can't _do_ anything with them.

You could make an app. Maybe a two-model CRUD app, like a very simple social network or bookmark tracker. But you've already started five of those and [have yet to finish one](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/). If you do the UI first then the back-end is overwhelming; if you do the back-end first then the UI is a pain. And then you have to get people to actually use it.

## So what _do_ you do?

Make something small and stupid.

It's hard to get someone to use an app. It's easy to get someone to look at a page called [DucksAreTheBest.com](https://theuselessweb.site/ducksarethebest.com/).

It probably took half an hour to make. It does absolutely nothing.

At the time these readme was written, it had been shared 32,000 times on Facebook and is worth $30,000.

Another great place to browse is [codepen](https://codepen.io/trending), especially for you visually-oriented folks! Maybe you make a new codepen a day and have an archive of them on your portfolio!

## Build things that are silly, because people like silly things

Not only can you gain notoriety and possibly even money: you will learn a tremendous amount making even the most mundane, goofy things.

This is the one of the **two best things you can do to advance your career right now**. The other is:

## Teach. That is: get paid to network and learn

You may be "just" a junior developer, but you know more about the world's fastest-growing industry than 99% of the world's population. That 99% _wants_ to know what you know. And since covid, the demand for coding training has sky-rocketted.

* **Teach for another technical school:** In addition to GA, there are many, many other companies and non-profit organizations that could use teachers and volunteers!
* **Make your own content:** Teaching someone else's curriculum or helping someone complete a pre-existing assignment is one thing, but it's a whole new challenge to come up with _your own lesson_. Take a crack at making your own Youtube tutorial, or make like Gen Z and start coding on Twitch!
* **Reach out to your community:** Teach an hour-long class on the very basics of HTML and CSS for your library or church. Teach for free, and then start charging.

In return, you get:

1. Networking. Your students will come to you if they need a designer or developer.
2. Knowledge. No-one expects you to know all the answers. The questions you're asked will dramatically deepen your knowledge of development.
3. Reputation. Nothing says "I'm a confident, caring developer who communicates well" like having taught a class. Evidence of your ability to function on a team is just as important as evidence of your ability to code.

**The two most enjoyable and marketable things in development are building stuff and talking about building stuff.** Do these, and you'll find them doing the networking for you.
