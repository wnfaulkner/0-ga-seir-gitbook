# More Hooks

## What other Hooks are there?

Here are some of the more popular ones:

* `useContext` - Allows use of the Context API, useful for decoupling state from components
* `useReducer` - Used for more complex state manipulations. Works very similarly to Redux.
* `useRef` - Allows for the use of refs to DOM objects
* `useLayoutEffect` - A synchronous version of useEffect used for reading layout metrics and then re-rendering based on those.

There are a few more and more are being added all the time. You can also create your own custom hooks yourself using `useEffect`!

## Conclusion

Hooks represent an improvement in React code organization and reasonability. You don't have to use them since class-based components still exist and work but Facebook is recommending that you try them out since they lend themselves to a better development experience.
