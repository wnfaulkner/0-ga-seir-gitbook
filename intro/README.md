# Python

## Python

### Objectives

* Describe the history of the Python language
* Identify fundamentals and concepts of the Python language
* Utilize different primitive types, control structures, and methods in Python
* Use the `python3` interactive shell
* Write a program that responds to user input

### Python History

**Benevolent Dictator For Life**

![Guido van Rossum](https://www.computing.co.uk/api/v1/wps/36af8c1/e1200afd-ed3c-4084-8013-e47653a5a813/2/guido-van-rossum-python-580x358.jpg)

* Guido van Rossum \(Dutch\) built Python as a hobby project on his winter break

**Goals**

* An easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors
* Open source, so anyone can contribute to its development
* Code that is as understandable as plain English
* Suitability for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times

**Releases**

* Python 1.0 realeased 1991
* Python 2.0 \(2000\) - started to gather a development community
* Python 3.0 \(2008\) - unified the language more at the cost of making some old 2.0 code incompatible

**Advantages**

* high-level language \(closer to english than machine code\)
* interpreted \(as opposed to compiled\)programming language \(compiled languages have to be run through a compiler that changes

  source code into compiled code before the program can be run, whereas interpreted

  languages are run on the fly 

* general purpose scripting language that runs outside a browser
* free and open source \(community development through Python Enhancement Proposals\)
* comes with a _huge_ library of builtin functions
* The [documentation](http://python.org/) is fantastic

## Python Features and Syntax!

Python is a great first-language to learn because it's \(for the most part\) akin to talking at your computer. That's because Python design philosophy which emphasizes code readability. You'll often find that your first guess at what a function is called is surprisingly correct.

For instance, if you want to print something, you write:

```python
print("I'm not dead yet!")
```

Also, it's true. Python's name is derived from Monty Python.

### Philosophy

The core philosophy of Python is summarized by the document [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) , which includes aphorisms such as:

* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts

### What's New?

Python is _just like javascript with slightly different syntax_. There are very few **major** differences between Python and Javascript, but here are a few things that will be new:

#### Negative String Indexes!!

Python has some little features that make code really sweet to write. Negative string \(and array\) indexes is simply one example of great syntax options Python offers.

```python
alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
vowels = "aeiou"

# we can use negative numbers to access characters in a string from backwards!
last_letter = alphabet[-1]
third_to_last_letter = alphabet[-3]
print(last_letter, "is the last letter in the alphabet")
print(third_to_last_letter, "is the third to last letter in the alphabet")

# we can use the `in` keyword to see if something is part of a string!
if ("e" in vowels):
  print("yup. that's a vowel.")
```

#### Whitespace

Python never uses curly braces to define blocks of code. Instead, it forces programmers to write their code with proper whitespace. Many people find this annoying and you're bound to hear people scoff at Python for this decision.

Here's what a for loop and an if else statement look like in Python. The whitespace is important! You have to consistently indent with tabs, or spaces. Whichever you choose you have to be consistent with how many tabs or spaces you use at each level!

Notice that Python uses a weird word `elif` for "else if" statements.

```python
for i in range(1, 18):
  if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
    print("divisible by three and five")
  elif i % 3 == 0:
    print("divisible by three")
  elif i % 5 == 0:
    print("divisible by five")
  else:
    print(i)
```
