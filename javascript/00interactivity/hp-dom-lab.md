## DOM Magic

### Intro

You are now a wizard and you will no longer hard code html during your time at Hogwarts \(or the duration of this assignment\)   
 You will make things appear and disappear \(and more\) with the magic of javascript!  
 This assignment is recommended to be done with a Harry Potter theme. But if you are unfamiliar with Harry Potter, that's cool, you can make up all your wizard details.

### Setup - Get Ready to Make So Much Magic

* Make a directory called `hogwarts`.
* `cd` into the `hogwarts` folder
* `touch index.html`
* `touch main.css`
* `touch app.js`
* `code .`

#### In main.css

```css
body {background-color: #F8F7FF}/*or any color of your choosing*/
```

#### In app.js

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ()=>{
    console.log('DOM is loaded!')
})
```

#### In `index.html`

* `!` + `tab` to set up boilerplate html
* Add a title inside the `<title>`tags \(where will this title appear?\)
* Connect your CSS in the `<head>` tag:  
  * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">`
* Add a `<div id="container"></div>` inside the `<body>` tags
* Connect your javascript at the bottom of the `<body>` tag:
  * `<script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>`

#### In terminal

* `open index.html` to open your webpage in the browser

#### In the browser

* `âŒ˜ âŒ¥ I` - to open Chrome Dev Tools
* Check: did your background-color for your page load? Do you see your title in the tab? If not, fix it now.
* Check: did your console.logs log?

#### In app.js

* comment out or delete your console.logs, now that you know everything is linked and loaded correctly.
* Set up your workflow, you will be going between your `index.html` `app.js` files, your browser and these instructions - make it so you don't need to move your windows every time you need to change
* Pull up the class notes on DOM lessons to have as a reference:
  * [DOM and Events](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/javascript/00interactivity/01readme)
  * [DOM Manipulation](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/javascript/00interactivity/02more-manipulation)
  * [DOM Review](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/seirfx/javascript/00interactivity/intro-to-dom-2)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Received Hogwarts letter - All files are linked and loaded"

### Year 1

**Important** : You are encouraged to comment out console.logs that you no longer need. There will be no further prompts for this advice.

#### In app.js

* Query for your div with the `id` of `container` and set it to a variable named `container`
* console.log `container`
* Create an `<h1>` element and set it to a variable called `h1` and console log it
* Add some text inside the `h1` element. Example text: 'Hogwarts'
* Why isn't your `h1` appearing on your page?

  Hint

  It needs to be appended

  * Append your `h1` to your `container`

&lt;/details&gt;

* **It's magic! Isn't it?**
* In your `main.css` file, add a css rule where all text will align center inside the `body`

Test yourself Your HTML structure should look like this !\[image of dev console elements\]\(https://i.imgur.com/IXlUnOO.png\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 1 - added h1 using javascript"

### Year 2

Following what you did in Year 1, add the following:

* `h2` element with your name
* `h3` element with your house \(Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or Slytherin \)
* `h4` element with your pet's name
  * this `h4` element should have a class with a value of your pet type \(owl, cat, toad, etc\)
* `h4` element with your wand \(You can make it whatever you want. Need help coming up with one? Here is one of many websites to help you find your wand [playbuzz.com](http://www.playbuzz.com/terryraynor10/which-wand-would-you-be-given-in-the-world-of-harry-potter) \)
* In your `main.css` add an attribute of `font-family: fantasy;` to all elements that have a class that matches your pet's class

  Test yourself Your HTML structure should look like this !\[image of dev console elements\]\(https://i.imgur.com/5rFQeod.png\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 2 - I added more elements. My power grows with my dedication and hard work"

### Year 3

Following what you did in previous years, add the following into an unordered list \(with the [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) of `storage` and a value of `trunk`\):

* list items of
  * butter beer
  * invisibility cloak \(add a class of secret\)
  * magic map \(add a class of secret\)
  * time turner \(add a class of secret\)
  * leash \(for your pet, be sure to give this list element the same class as you gave your pet\)
  * Bertie Bott's Every Flavor \[Jelly\] Beans.
  * append the unordered list to your container div
  * In your `main.css` file, give the items with a class of secret an attribute of `opacity: 0.5;`
  * In your `main.css` file, remove the bullet points from the list items

Test yourself Your HTML structure should look like this !\[image of dev console elements\]\(https://i.imgur.com/obTO6qD.png\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 3 - I added list elements. That code didn't seem very dry. I wonder if there is something I could do about it in the Hungry for More section"

### Year 4

You want to show off how many classes you are taking

* Make a table

**Hint:** Look under `More Examples`, `<p>Simple table with header</p>` at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) to see the correct HTML element layout

* Right above your table add an `h5` that says 'Spring 2017'
* Inside the table add a `thead` element
* Inside the `thead` element add two `th` elements
  * in the first `th` add the text `Day`
    * in the second `th` add the text `Classes`
* Create a `tr` element and add two `td` elements inside.
  * in the first `td` add the day Monday
    * in the second `td` add the classes you are taking \( Herbology, Divination, History of Magic, Charms, Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Quidditch practice, etc.\)
* Create more `tr` elements with `td`s inside so that you have Monday - Friday and classes each of those days
* In your `main.css` file, add a gray 1px solid border around your `table`, `th` elements and `td` elements
* In your `main.css` file, add a rule that will center your `table` on the page

Test yourself Your HTML structure should look like this !\[image of dev console elements\]\(https://i.imgur.com/Ic4hfy7.png\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 4 - I realize I can make things that are ever increasingly more complex with greater ease. Adding order is always more effort than causing chaos."

### Year 5

Things get interesting

* Break your wand! \(select the element that contains your wand and remove it\)
* Class was hard! Drink all your butter beer! \(remove just the butter beer from your list\)
* Get a new wand \(add the same element back with new text describing your new wand. Be sure to insert it after your pet in the DOM\)
* Make your new wand stand out by adding a `color` of `indigo` \(or whatever color you like\). But do it with magic \(DOM manipulation\): Don't add this css in your `main.css` file
* Send your pet on a spy mission \(remove your pet from the DOM, put it somewhere else in your HTML\). Make sure your pet's leash stays in your trunk \(list item with the same class as your pet inside `unordered list`\)
* Have your pet come back \(remove your pet from the DOM, put it back in its original location\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 5 - The days go by slowly and the years go by too fast"

### Year 6

School is so fun!

* Nosey roommate alert! Hide all your belongings with a class of secret.
* Nosey roommate falls asleep 2 seconds later. Show your secret belongings after 2+ seconds using a `setTimeout` to prevent showing your secret elements too soon.
* Accident! You transmogrified your pet's leash into half cabbage
  * add the class cabbage to your pet's leash. Do not replace your pet's leash's original class.  Your pet, which also has the same class should remain unaffected
  * add a rule of `color:chartreuse;` in your `main.css` for all elements that have a class of cabbage
* Fix your pet's leash by removing the class of cabbage \(be sure to keep your pet's leash's original class\)

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 6 - A cauliflower is a cabbage with a college education - Mark Twain"

### Year 7

Though your time at Hogwarts is nearly over, your journey of learning has just begun

* Update your class schedule to read 'Fall 2018'
* Celebrate by buying more butter beer! Append a list item with the text 'Butter beer' as the first list item inside your unordered list with the value of `trunk`
* Whoops! You broke your trunk when you stood on it while singing karaoke. Get a new storage container for your stuff; replace the unodered list's property of `trunk` with a new property of `chest`
* Add some CSS to your page. Feel free to experiment and make this page your own

 ðŸ”´ The commit message should read:   
 "Year 7 - I am getting more comfortable with ambiguous instructions"

### Post-Graduation \(Hungry for More - choose any\)

* Research how to and then [add a Favicon](https://bitsofco.de/all-about-favicons-and-touch-icons/)  \(ok to hard code this in your `index.html`\)
* Refactor your code. Make it more dry. Are there places you could have used a for-loop? Functions you could have created?
* Clean up your code. Check indentation and be sure you have plenty of comments.
* Add CSS animations. Get inspiration [here](http://animista.net/)
* Add more delays to show your pet leaving and coming back from its mission Get inspiration [here](https://youtu.be/7GjssFdiUNw)

### Technical Requirements

1. Your JavaScript files MUST run without syntax errors. If there are errors you can't solve, comment them out and leave a comment above explaining what is wrong
