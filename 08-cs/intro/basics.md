# Basics

Here we'll use object-oriented programming to build a basic linked list in python. We'll need a `Node` class and a `LinkedList` class.

## Node

```python
class Node:
    # constructor
    def __init__(self, data, next):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

    def __str__(self): # tell python how to print this node
        return str(self.data)
```

_**Challenge:**_ How would you modify this code to accomodate a doubly linked list? \(This is currently only set up for a singly-linked list.\)

## LinkedList

Properties and basic functionality we'll include:

* head
* tail
* length \(how many nodes in the list\)
* `__len__` \(return the length of the list\)
* `__str__` \(return a string representation of the list\)

```python
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.size = 0

    # returns length of the list
    def __len__(self):
        return self.size

    def __str__(self):
        if self.size == 0:
            return '[]'

        current = self.head
        result = str(current) # what we return once we've concantenated all the nodes to it
        while current.next:
            result += f' -> {str(current.next)}'
            current = current.next
        return f'[{result}]'
```

This is great and all, but how we need to actually load our list with nodes, which means we need to add some functionality to our `LinkedList` class that allows us to add nodes to our list!
